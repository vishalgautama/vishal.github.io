## Acknowledgements

- Huge shoutout to [@JoshWComeau](https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau) and his amazing work on the course - "Joy of React". I have been working with React for a couple of years now, but being self taught, there were plenty of holes and inconsistencies in my knowledge. This is the first course I've ever purchased and it has not only made me better at React, but also helped me become a better developer.
- I've been a fan of [@raunofreiberg](https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg) work ever since I discovered his portfolio website. His work has influenced a lot of my ideas, styles, and designs. I'm not a trained designer, but as I grow, I aspire to build his level of attention to detail.
